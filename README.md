ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hazim!

Web Developer with over 3 years of commercial development of full-stack web applications. Experienced in Next, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, Express, CSS and HTML. I enjoy solving algorithms and Data structures problems, taking online courses (+50 certifications), and participating in forums, conferences and meetups. For me, being a developer means being a problem solver (not only in coding ðŸ˜‰).

Yes, I am ready to consider your offers, and I currently prefer to work remotely. You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/HaidariHazim) | [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hazim-alhaidairi).
